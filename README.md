# creditCardValidationPython
My implementation of a Credit Card Validator in Python. This application is able to detect & validate credit card numbers.

Millions of businesses process credit card transactions every day, and those businesses need a way to check to see if a credit card is active or not or if itâ€™s a fraudulent card. The issuing institution maintains a set of credit card numbers that adhere to specific standards, allowing for credit card verification. This makes it easier to detect fraudulently created credit cards or credit cards that are no longer active.

Credit card numbers follow certain patterns. A credit card number must have between 13 and 16 digits. It must start with:

4 for Visa cards 5 for Master cards 37 for American Express cards 6 for Discover cards

The problem can be solved by using Luhn algorithm. Luhn check or the Mod 10 check, which can be described as follows (for illustration, consider the card number 4388576018402626):

Step 1. Double every second digit from right to left. If doubling of a digit results in a two-digit number, add up the two digits to get a single-digit number (like for 12:1+2, 18=1+8).

Step 2. Now add all single-digit numbers from Step 1. 4 + 4 + 8 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 7 + 8 = 37

Step 3. Add all digits in the odd places from right to left in the card number. 6 + 6 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 7 + 8 + 3 = 38

Step 4. Sum the results from Step 2 and Step 3. 37 + 38 = 75

Step 5. If the result from Step 4 is divisible by 10, the card number is valid; otherwise, it is invalid.
